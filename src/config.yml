  Description: "Mappings to convert from [ICD-10](https://openmortality.org/data/icd10_v1) codes to [CGHR-10](https://openmortality.org/data/cghr10_v1) codes.\n\nJoin the column `icd10_code` to your data for the converted codes in column `cghr10_title`.\n\nTo correctly map the ICD-10 codes, be sure to also match the age group values `adult`, `child`, and `neo` in the column `cghr10_age`.\n\nIt may help to add a column specifying whether a record in your data is `adult`, `child` or `neo` to do the matching."
